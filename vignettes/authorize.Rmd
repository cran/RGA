Before you send any requests to the Google Analytics API, it's necessary to perform authorization and to obtain access token. It can be done with the following command:

```r
authorize()
```

After calling this function first time, a web browser will be opened. First entrance with a **Google Account** confirms access to the Google Analytics data. Note that the package requests access for the **read-only** data.

When the `authorize()` function is used, the `GAToken` (can be changed with `rga.token` option) variable is created in the separate `TokenEnv` environment which not visible for user. So, there is no need to pass every time the `token` argument to any function which requires authorization.

```r
list_profiles()
ga_data <- get_ga(profile.id = "ga:XXXXXXXX")
```

Access token can also be stored in a variable and passed as the argument to the functions which request the API Google Analytics. It can be useful when you are working with several accounts at the same time (for details see below).

```r
ga_token <- authorize(client.id = "client_id", client.secret = "client_secret")
ga_data <- get_ga(profile.id = "ga:XXXXXXXX", token = ga_token)
```

## Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials

`RGA` package provides predefined **Client ID** and **Client secret**, but you may need to create a new application in [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) and obtain a **Client ID** and **Client secret** to access to the Google Analytics API.

Step by step instructions are as follows:

1. Creation of a new project (can be skipped if the project is already created):
    * Open the page <https://console.developers.google.com/project> in your favorite browser;
    * Click on **Create Project** blue button at the top left of the page;
    * Enter the name of the project into the **PROJECT NAME** field in the pop-up window;
    * Click **Create** to confirm the creation of the project.
2. Enabling access to the Google Analytics API:
    * Select your project from the project list on https://console.developers.google.com/project page;
    * Select **APIs & auth**  in the left sidebar;
    * Click **OFF** for activation **Analytics API** (ensure that `OFF` turned to `ON`) in the **APIs** tab.
3. Creating a new application:
    * Select **APIs & auth** and then **Credentials** sub-menu in the left sidebar;
    * Click **Create new Client ID** on the left side of the page;
    * Select **Installed application** from the APPLICATION TYPE list and **Other** from INSTALLED APPLICATION TYPE list in the pop-up window.
    * Click on the **Create Client ID** button to confirm the creation of the application.
4. Obtaining Client ID and Client secret:
    * Select the project from the project list on the https://console.developers.google.com/project page;
    * Select **APIs & auth** and then **Credentials** sub-menu in the left sidebar;
    * Copy the values of the following fields: **Client ID** and **Client secret** in the **Client ID for native application** table.

You can return to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project) at any time to view the **Client ID** and **Client secret** on the Client ID for native application section on Credentials page.

## Use environment variables

Besides the explicit specifying of the `client.id` and `client.secret` arguments, their values can be defined via environment variables: `RGA_CLIENT_ID` and `RGA_CLIENT_SECRET`. In this case, specifying of the `client.id` and `client.secret` arguments is not required for calling `authorize()` function:

```r
authorize()
```

Note: do not put the **Client secret** on a publicly visible location.

Setting the environment variables is different for various operating systems. The user should refer to the relevant reference materials (view the list of references at the end of this manual). Also there is a setup method of the environment variables when running R sessions using the `.Renviron` files in the user's working or home directory. Contents of the file might look like this:

```bash
RGA_CLIENT_ID="client_id"
RGA_CLIENT_SECRET="client_secret"
```

Environment variables can also be set directly from R session using the `Sys.setenv` function. For instance:

```r
Sys.setenv(RGA_CLIENT_ID = "client_id", RGA_CLIENT_SECRET = "client_secret")
```

This string can be added to the file `.Rprofile` in the user's current Ð¾r home directory in order to set these variables automatically when the R session starts.

## Cache an access token to disk

When the `cache` argument and the `rga.cache` option is not changed, then after successful authorization the `.ga-token.rds` file with access token to Google API will be created in the current working directory. The `.ga-token.rds` file is used between sessions, i.e. at a subsequent call to the `authorize()`  function and authorization in the browser tab is not required. Using the `cache` argument you can also suppress caching (`FALSE` value) or specify an alternate path to the file storage (in this case It is necessary to specify the path and file name explicitly).

```r
authorize(client.id, client.secret, cache = "/path/to/file")
```

Also you can specify a cache path to change `rga.cache` option. After this you no need specify `cache` argument for calling `authorize()` function:

```r
options(rga.cache = "/path/to/file")
authorize(client.id, client.secret)
```

## Working with multiple tokens

If you want to work with `RGA` package with multiple Client IDs and Client secrets from different accounts (for example from business account at work and personal account at home) you need to clearly distinguish them. The best way in this case is creating two different tokens with disabled `cache` option:

```r
work_token <- authorize(client.id1, client.secret1, cache = FALSE)
home_token <- authorize(client.id2, client.secret2, cache = FALSE)
```

or define a specific cache path for each token:

```r
work_token <- authorize(client.id1, client.secret1, cache = "work.token")
home_token <- authorize(client.id2, client.secret2, cache = "home.token")
```

Then pass this token to other functions:

```r
list_profiles(token = work_token)
list_profiles(token = home_token)
```
